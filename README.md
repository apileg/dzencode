# Opening the website online

This website is available at [`https://194.61.52.204`](https://194.61.52.204). Note that I haven't
purchased an HTTPS certificate. Instead, I've used a self-signed one. Browser
will warn you about potentially unsafe website, but the warning is caused
by HTTPS. You can safely skip it

> Using self-signed certificate means that the site is vulnerable to MITM
> attacks. This is not essential for purposes of this task

There are two built-in users on the site, one of them is a jazz guitarist.
**To login**, use these credentials:

```
a@a.com
```

```
password
```

#

```
takanaka@seychelles.com
```

```
goblins
```

# Running locally

## Using docker

You can run the whole project using **Docker**:

```
npm run up
```

The app will be available at [`http://localhost:3001`](http://localhost:3001). To **turn off** the whole application use:

```
npm run down
```

Note that this **leaves the mysql image on your computer**. This might be what you want. If you want to delete the `mysql` image as well, run

```
npm run down-all
```

## Without Docker

If you don't want to use Docker, you can run the app locally. This
app was tested with **MySQL 8.0.33**

After you've installed MySQL, create a database named `dzencode`. Then,
change the `DATABASE_URL` variable in `/.env` file to use port 3306:

```
DATABASE_URL=mysql://root@localhost:3306/dzencode
```

Then run

```
npm run db:setup
```

To start the app, use

```
npm run build
```

```
npm run start
```

or

```
npm run dev
```

# Overview of functions

![GIF demonstrating the features](./docs/app.gif)

-   `/orders` page with listing or orders

    -   Orders can be expanded to show the list of their products
    -   Both orders and products can be deleted. There's a confirmation window
        before deletion

-   `/products` page with a table of products

    -   Each product can be deleted (also with confirmation window)
    -   Products can be filtered by their type using drop menu above the table

-   Each page contains a navbar and a top panel

    -   Top panel shows current date, current time, and number of currently
        opened sessions on the website (when you open a tab, you create +1 session)

-   When you visit a page that doesn't exist, custom `404` page is shown

-   When logged in users visit `/`, they get redirected to `/orders`

-   When guests visit any protected page (`/orders`, `products`), the get
    redirected to `/login`

-   `/login` page contains login form. Email and password are validated after
    submitting the form

# Technology Stack

-   SSR app: Next.js with pages router
-   CSS: Tailwind
-   Client-side logic:
    -   `zustand` (see [Why not Redux](#why-not-redux) below)
    -   TanStack Query (React Query) for data fetching
-   Database access: Prisma + MySQL
-   Web sockets: socket.io and socket-io.client
-   API:
    -   Next.js api handlers
    -   `zod` for input validation
-   Authentication:
    -   `jose` for JWT verification/signing
    -   `bcrypt` for password hashing
-   Task runners: `package.json scripts` + `tsx` + `execa`
-   Tests:
    -   Runner: `jest` + `ts-jest` for TS support
    -   Unit tests of hooks: React Testing Library
    -   API + DB integration tests:
        -   `jest`, `axios` for requests, dockerized MySQL
-   Deployment:
    -   This site is deployed to a Linux server that runs `docker compose up -d`
    -   Since [Next.js has no way of configuring HTTPS without using custom server](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/discussions/10935), this site runs behind Nginx that has HTTPS
        configured

# Details

## General Architecture

![alt text](./docs/diagrams/components.png)

Note the naming:

-   Entities are objects that are stored in the database. We call entities
    with `-Entity` suffix, e.g. `OrderEntity`

-   Models are objects that represent our problem domain. Since our wesite
    is a system for tracking orders and products, our domain objects are
    `Order` and `Product`. They are called without any suffixes

-   Props are the objects that are passed to our React components. They
    are called in form `ComponentNameProps`, e.g. `OrderListProps`

## Tests

### Overview

We use two kinds of tests in this project: **unit** and **integration**.

Unit tests test React hooks used on client side. Integration tests cover
API + Authentication + Database access.

Here's a diagram showing which tests cover which parts of the system:

![alt text](./docs/diagrams/tests.png)

### Running

To run unit tests:

```

npm run test:unit

```

To run api (integration) tests:

```

npm run test:api

```

## Database

### Schema

## NPM scripts

-   `up` - start the whole app in Docker Compose
-   `down` - turns off the app started by `up`
-   `down-all` turns off the app like `down`, and also deletes `mysql`
    docker image
-   `docker:build` - build images of the Next.js app (called `docker-app`)
-   `docker:save` - exports the image of the Next.js app into `./docker/app.tar`. I used it for deployment
-   `lint`, `dev`, `start`, `build` - standard Next.js commands
-   `db`:
    -   `db:start` - run MySQL docker container on port 330**7**
    -   `db:stop` - stop the MySQL container
    -   `db:migrate` - connect to the DB specified in `.env` in `DATABASE_URL` and run migrations (bootstrap schema)
    -   `db:seed` - connect to database like `db:migrate`, and fill it with mock
        data
    -   `db:dump` - create dump of dzencode database
    -   `db:setup` - runs both `db:migrate` and `db:seed`
    -   `db` - shortcut for `docker compose -f /path/to/mysql/compose.yml`. Can be used like `npm run db up --build --force-recreate`
-   `test:unit` and `test:api` - described above
-   `https` - generate self-signed HTTPS certificate at `./docker/https`
-   `copy-env` - copy `.env.sample` to `.env`, used in `up`

## Security

We use JWT in this project. How should we pass it from server to client and
vice versa?

Generally, there are two ways to pass/store JWT:

Cookies:

-   Pros:
    -   If marked as `HttpOnly`, they cannot be stolen via `XSS` attack
    -   If marked as `Secure`, they will never be sent unencrypted, and thus cannot be stolen by sniffing traffic
-   Cons:
    -   Cookies are prone to `CSRF` attacks. This can be mitigated by setting `SameSite: Strict` attribute. This attribute, however, if too strict for our app. We can use `SameSite: Lax`, but this leaves `GET` endpoints vulnerable. `GET` endpoints shouldn't do side effects, but this is not enforced in any way

`localStorage`:

-   Pros:
    -   Immune to `CSRF` attacks
-   Cons:
    -   Does not enforce `HTTPS`
    -   Can be stolen if the site has `XSS` vulnerability

I've chosen cookies because the website uses SSR. To visit protected
SSR page, you need to somehow pass your JWT token. The only way to
do that with `localStorage` is to first load some JS code that will
grab the token from `localStorage` and send it - this is not SSR

I've used special attributes on cookie to make it more secure:

-   Per OWASP recommendation, I've called it `id` - not very descriptive
    name to hide details about tech stack I use
-   I've set `Secure` and `HttpOnly`
-   I've set `SameSite: Lax`

At the moment **there's no protection against CSRF on GET routes**.
**However**, this is not an issue, because `GET` requests in this app don't mutate
state

# Why not Redux

## Technical part

Reasons why I have chosen zustand over redux with next-redux-wrapper are:

-   Simplicity and Less Boilerplate: zustand offers a simpler and more concise API compared to Redux. With zustand, you don't need to define actions, reducers, or switch statements. It uses a function-based approach, allowing you to directly update the state using simple JavaScript functions
-   Fewer Dependencies: zustand has minimal dependencies, often requiring only a few kilobytes of code. In contrast, Redux relies on additional middleware, such as Redux Thunk or Redux Saga, for handling asynchronous actions. zustand includes built-in support for async/await, making it easier to handle asynchronous logic without the need for extra dependencies
-   Performance: zustand provides a lightweight state management solution with optimized reactivity. It leverages React's built-in useContext and useReducer hooks, resulting in efficient updates and rendering optimizations. Redux, on the other hand, introduces more overhead due to its centralized store and immutability requirements
-   Server-Side Rendering (SSR) and Hydration: zustand seamlessly integrates with server-side rendering frameworks like Next.js, offering straightforward handling of the HYDRATE event. This ensures the proper synchronization of state between the server and the client, simplifying the SSR process. Redux, while compatible with SSR, requires additional configuration and middleware to handle hydration effectively

## Problematic part

I attempt to pass data from the orders file to the redux store via getServerSideProps and encountered an issue with the next-redux-wrapper library. The purpose was to immediately load the order list during server-side rendering. However, the next-redux-wrapper failed to catch the HYDRATE event, which prevented the proper synchronization of the state between the server and the client.
